1. When is slurm going to be installed?

2. How to be allowed to create shared folders in home?

3. Partitioning of filesystems - where is work folder where is storage folder?
	- want to avoid people all working from their home folder
	- where are the remaining 60+TB of storage space mounted?

4. General installation questions:
	- if individual users install a package via EasyBuild, it goes into their local easybuild modules directory, how can we share this?
	- most users will be using conda environments, so could miniforge be installed centrally as well?

5. Admin rights - could laura, yin, jessica also get sudo privileges?
